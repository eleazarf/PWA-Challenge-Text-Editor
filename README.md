 ## Description
This progressive web application operates seamlessly online and offline, even in a standalone context, thanks to an integrated service worker and Cache APIs. Its purpose is to provide users with a platform for taking notes and writing code snippets, ensuring functionality regardless of their internet connection status.

 ## Installation
To set up, run 'npm install' in the root directory's console. This fetches required node modules/packages from the package.json files in the root, client, and server levels.

After installing dependencies, run "npm run start:dev" in the console to concurrently launch both the client and server.

Also, the live deployment is available on Heroku, accessible through this ![link]() .
